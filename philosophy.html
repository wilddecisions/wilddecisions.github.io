<p>This page describes Brian Folt’s personal philosophy toward research,
teaching, and mentorship in the field of applied ecology.</p>
<div id="philosophy" class="section level2">
<h2><u><strong>Philosophy</strong></u></h2>
<p>Native species, ecosystems, and natural ways of life are rapidly
being lost due to pervasive anthropogenic stressors around the world. I
feel an <strong>ethical duty</strong> as a biologist to conduct research
that goes beyond testing theory and instead (1) generates
<strong>practical solutions</strong> for natural resource management
problems and (2) trains <strong>diverse cohorts</strong> of
<strong>scientists and practitioners</strong>. To this end, I describe
here my professional philosophy, including my <strong>research interests
and approach</strong>, philosophy toward <strong>teaching and
mentorship</strong>, and approach to ensuring <strong>diversity and
inclusion</strong> in the field of wildlife biology.</p>
<div id="research-statement" class="section level3">
<h3><u><strong>Research Statement</strong></u></h3>
<p>I am an <strong>applied population biologist</strong> that focuses on
developing management strategies for at-risk species and ecosystems in
the face of global change. I conduct fundamental research that tests
hypotheses about how <strong>habitats</strong> and
<strong>landscapes</strong> influence <strong>animal population
dynamics</strong>, and then I work to understand how populations,
habitats, and landscapes can be <strong>managed</strong> in ways that
maximize important societal <strong>values</strong>. My research program
combines data collection in the field with modern advances in
quantitative analytical methods to address the needs of wildlife
managers and conservationists. My quantitative expertise includes using
<strong>Bayesian hierarchical methods</strong> to estimate and model how
<strong>environmental variation influences the demographic rates and
population dynamics</strong> of populations, species, and wildlife
communities through time. I have worked with diverse organisms (mammals,
amphibians, reptiles), ecosystems (western rangelands, long-leaf pine
forests, tropical rain forests), and questions (theoretical and
applied), but my research is currently centered around two themes: the
effects of multiple stressors on declining species, and decision
analysis to support natural resource management decisions. My work spans
different spatial and temporal scales (e.g., <strong>local to range-wide
spatial scales</strong>) and takes advantage of advanced quantitative
tools that are useful for projections and supporting decisions.
<strong>Collaboration</strong> is critical and I work closely with
<strong>partner agencies</strong>, such as the Alabama Dept. of
Conservation and Natural Resources, Nevada Dept. of Wildlife, U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service, and Bureau of Land Management, to
<strong>co-produce</strong> applied science that suits agency needs.
Through targeted research within these partnerships, my over-arching
goal is to provide science to support smart decisions in natural
resource management.</p>
<p>I want my work to support regional management needs; to this end, I
have studied the effects of <strong>multiple anthropogenic
stressors</strong> on vertebrate populations. I often use <strong>risk
assessment</strong> approaches to understand the many ways in which
species can be threatened by global change, including climate change,
sea-level rise, altered habitat management, urbanization,
human-subsidized predators, wildfire, and invasive species. I recently
modeled how Gopher Tortoise populations might persist in a changing
world with diverse anthropogenic threats, which produced a risk
assessment useful for a federal Species Status Assessment. I am
currently involved in efforts seeking to understand how threats and
management actions in the Mojave Desert ecosystem might influence the
population dynamics of the federally listed <strong>Mojave Desert
Tortoise</strong> under future conditions of global change. I am also
interested in supporting ecosystem resilience through better management
of <strong>ecosystem engineers</strong>, such as gopher tortoises and
federally protected ‘wild horses’ and ‘wild burros’. In particular, I
have worked with the <strong>Bureau of Land Management</strong> to
better manage horse populations and minimize their effects on western
rangeland ecosystems by providing <strong>hierarchical models of
population dynamics</strong> and predictive models of tradeoffs among
management alternatives <a
href="https://rconnect.usgs.gov/popequus/"><em>PopEquus</em></a>.</p>
<p>At the <strong>University of Nevada Reno</strong>, I hope to continue
to nurture strong working relationships with state and federal
governmental agencies to address wildlife and natural resource
management issues, such as how global change is influencing non-game and
game species in Nevada and the West. To do so, I will develop effective
working relationships with managers and decision makers and support
their decision processes with a <strong>structured-decision
making</strong> and <strong>co-production</strong> toolkit. Past
examples of my capacity for decision-support research includes
facilitating meetings with decision makers and stakeholders to (1) frame
problems, objectives, and management alternatives, and then (2) build
predictive modeling <strong>tools</strong> to evaluate the consequences
and tradeoffs among alternatives being considered. Importantly, this
framework helps managers make decisions that balance <strong>multiple
competing objectives</strong>, such as the reintroduction of endangered
species, management of invasive species (e.g., wild horses), ecosystem
restoration, and minimizing cost, all while accounting for the diverse
and varying values of stakeholders. My research will continue to use
<strong>structured decision making</strong> and
<strong>co-production</strong> to clearly frame problems, generate
shared understanding of issues, and build <strong>tools</strong> to
identify alternatives that balance competing objectives of decision
makers and stakeholders for contentious and difficult management
problems in the Great Basin ecosystem. Because Nevada is the epicenter
of the horse management problem in North America, I hope to continue to
support research needs for this problem.</p>
<div id="teaching-philosophy" class="section level4">
<h4><u><strong>Teaching Philosophy</strong></u></h4>
<p>I believe that the future of wildlife management is rooted in strong
<strong>education</strong> about the natural world and how it can be
<strong>managed</strong>. To this end, I have worked to educate and
train future scientists from <strong>diverse constuencies</strong> by
mentoring students (<em>n</em> = 10), teaching university courses and
workshops, and engaging in public outreach activities. My teaching style
blends <strong>fun lectures</strong> with active learning through group
discussions and individual/group projects in the <strong>classroom, lab,
or field</strong>. I aim to teach students <strong>practical
skills</strong> in study design, analysis, technical writing, and
science communication – often through project-based assignments – so
students will be <strong>capable and confident</strong> when they leave
the classroom and head out into the professional community. Given my
research strengths in applied population biology and structured decision
making, I hope to offer classes in <strong>quantitative ecology</strong>
and <strong>decision analysis for natural resource management</strong>
at the <strong>University of Nevada - Reno</strong> (UNR), and also
mentoring students in this topics.</p>
<p>My ultimate goal in graduate student mentorship is to teach students
the <strong>fundamental skills</strong> necessary for their independence
as professionals in our field. To do this, students in my laboratory
will benefit from <strong>regular lab meetings</strong> where we will
discuss literature, work on lab projects, share results of ongoing
research (e.g., proposals, conference presentations, thesis chapters),
and troubleshoot problems. The laboratory will include students and
professionals at different educational levels (e.g., MS, PhD, post-doc)
to provide opportunities for within-lab learning and mentorship from
diverse backgrounds. However, there is no single approach to student
mentorship, so I will be intentional about working to <strong>understand
the interests and goals</strong> of each student during regular 1-on-1
meetings and <strong>catering their experience</strong> (e.g., projects,
coursework, committees, conferences, professional network) to best set
them up for success along their desired career path. The graduate
student experience can be a challenging one, and I will be
<strong>sensitive and supportive</strong> of student during the
ups-and-downs of their program. Additionally, I recognize that I am
relatively early in my career, and I will regularly seek feedback from
students and peers about how I can improve mentorship and better serve
students.</p>
</div>
<div id="diversity-and-inclusion-in-wildlife-biology"
class="section level4">
<h4><u><strong>Diversity and Inclusion in Wildlife
Biology</strong></u></h4>
<p>I believe that <strong>diversity, equity, and inclusion
(DEI)</strong> are critical to the professional field of wildlife
biology because a more diverse workforce will improve our work, better
engage the public, and ultimately enact positive societal change into
the future. To this end, I aim to promote DEI in wildlife biology
through three mechanisms: <strong>environment</strong>,
<strong>recruitment</strong>, and <strong>retention</strong>. I will
create an <strong>inclusive laboratory environment</strong> by embracing
DEI as core values that are embedded within lab activities. Examples
include, but are not limited to, having <strong>explicit lab
policies</strong> that promote inclusivity (e.g., harrassment and
accommodation policies), participating in scientific societies and
conferences that serve underrepresented groups (e.g., Society for the
Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science), and seeking
out <strong>research collaborations</strong> with institutions that
support diversity initiatives (e.g., tribal colleges, HBCUs, NSF
Research Experience for Undergraduate [REU] Programs). These activities
and societies will then provide opportunities for
<strong>recruitment</strong> of promising students from historically
underrepresented groups in wildlife biology to join our lab. Diversity
will be <strong>celebrated</strong> within the lab and will ultimately
benefit our work through different backgrounds, life experiences, and
viewpoints. For example, I am proud of the diverse students I have
mentored in undergraduate and graduate studies to date, four of which
went on to pursue and receive graduate degrees in wildlife sciences.</p>
