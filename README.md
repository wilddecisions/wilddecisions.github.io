## The Wildlife Decision-Support Shop: Code to Create a GitHub Pages Website

## Authors

Brian Folt

## Overview

This repository contains code and materials to create a website advertising the work and activities of the **Wildlife Decision-Support Shop**, a research laboratory in the [**Nevada Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit**](https://www.unr.edu/nvcfwru) at the [University of Nevada, Reno](https://www.unr.edu/nres). The website is hosted using GitHub 'pages' ('jekyll-theme-minimal' theme) and is structured according to a '_site.yml', which specifies the page names included. Each page is then coded using Rmarkdown files and CSS from either the '_site.yml' file or custom CSS on each page. Various pictures and files are housed in folders within the repository.

The resulting website is hosted at [https://wilddecisions.github.io/](https://wilddecisions.github.io/).
