<h2><u><strong>Graduate Student Expectations</strong></u></h2>
<p>This page describes my practical philosophy and expectations for
students considering graduate studies in our research group. I adapted
this content largely from a documented produced by my colleague,
Dr. Jeff Falke, but customized it for my needs more specifically. A PDF
of this document is <a href="student_expectations.pdf">here</a>. If
hyperlinks in the PDF don’t work, check back here to the webpage
format.</p>
<p>Last updated: 8 September 2025</p>
<div id="what-is-graduate-school" class="section level3">
<h3><u><strong>What is graduate school?</strong></u></h3>
<p>As an undergraduate, you likely became skilled at juggling 4–5
classes per semester, writing papers, and studying for exams. Graduate
school is a different experience. Rather, graduate school is about
inquisitiveness, focus, and developing expertise through mentored
research, perhaps while taking minimum load of courses. In some
semesters, you may not take any courses at all. The emphasis shifts to
focus more conducting independent research and growing professionally as
a scientist, rather than coursework and memorization.</p>
</div>
<div id="graduate-student-characteristics-i-look-for"
class="section level3">
<h3><u><strong>Graduate student characteristics I look
for</strong></u></h3>
<p>I look for graduate students that are mature, creative, thoughtful
(i.e., ask good questions); who work hard and, at times, independently;
who have field or lab research experience; and who write well. And
perhaps most importantly, I look for folks who will ‘fit in’ to a
positive, diverse, and fun culture and community in the lab, Unit, and
UNR.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-it-takes-to-be-successful-in-graduate-school"
class="section level3">
<h3><u><strong>What it takes to be successful in graduate
school</strong></u></h3>
<p>Graduate school requires more self-motivation and initiative than
being an undergraduate student. You will have greater control over your
education and what you gain from it. I found grad school to be
challenging, but much more interesting and enjoyable than my
undergraduate experience. You will need to learn how to think ahead,
multi-task, communicate with staff and colleagues, and plan and
coordinate complex work and problems. You’ll be pretty busy and will
have to be good at managing your time. You’ll need to absorb lots of
information, analyze data, and interpret and synthesize findings to
provide new and useful knowledge. Then you will learn how to communicate
that knowledge to others in written and oral formats. Throughout all of
this, ‘people skills’ and networking will be required. A host of folks
can help you be successful, including undergrads, fellow graduate
students, professors, post-docs, lab managers, agency biologists, and
other experts in the field - but only if you let them.</p>
</div>
<div id="financial-support" class="section level3">
<h3><u><strong>Financial Support</strong></u></h3>
<p>All of my graduate students are supported through research
assistantships. These positions come with competitive stipends that are
on-par with those offered by comparable programs at other universities
nationwide. In order to maintain focus and make steady progress toward
your degree, outside employment is not permitted – I believe graduate
school requires your full attention and commitment.</p>
<p>Tuition is covered as part of your assistantship, and all graduate
students at the University of Nevada, Reno are charged in-state
(resident) tuition rates. You are encouraged to register for the minimum
number of credits required for graduation. This helps reduce tuition
costs and allows us to allocate more grant funds toward essential
research expenses, such as travel to scientific meetings and
conferences.</p>
</div>
<div id="reading" class="section level3">
<h3><u><strong>Reading</strong></u></h3>
<p>Becoming familiar with the scientific literature related to your
research can feel overwhelming at first – but it’s a critical part of
graduate training. You will need to quickly develop skills in literature
searching and critical reading of scientific papers. Beyond staying
current in your specific research area, I expect you to stay informed
about broader issues in applied ecology.</p>
<p>Make it a habit to regularly scan the tables of contents of major
journals such as <em>Nature</em>, <em>Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences (PNAS)</em>, <em>Conservation Biology</em>, as well
as key review journals (e.g., <em>Trends in Ecology &amp;
Evolution</em>), and discipline-specific journals (e.g., <em>Ecological
Applications</em>, <em>Journal of Wildlife Management</em>, etc.). This
will help you identify important developments and foundational papers in
your field.</p>
<p>The UNR library offers excellent resources, including support from
subject-specific Science Librarians. I encourage you to contact <a
href="ashannon@unr.edu">Dr. Amy Shannon</a> to learn how to make the
most of these services. You can also visit the library website to set up
alerts through Web of Science or Google Scholar that notify you
automatically when new papers are published on topics relevant to your
research.</p>
</div>
<div id="academic-requirements" class="section level3">
<h3><u><strong>Academic Requirements</strong></u></h3>
<p>There are at least two degree-granting programs that you could pursue
as a graduate student in our group, including the <strong>Natural
Resources and Environmental Sciences (NRES)</strong> Program and the
<strong>Ecology, Evolution, and Conservation Biology (EECB)</strong>
Program. Both programs offer MS or PhD degrees, and academic
requirements vary by program and degree. The choice of which of these
programs to enroll in might depend on a choosing between trade-offs
related to required coursework, resources provided, academic
communities, and the ultimate name of degree on your diploma. More
information for each program can be found here: <a
href="https://www.unr.edu/eecb/current-students/handbook">EECB</a>, <a
href="https://www.unr.edu/nres/graduate-programs/natural-resources-environmental-science/nres-masters-program/master-of-science-handbook">NRES
MS</a>, or <a
href="https://www.unr.edu/nres/graduate-programs/natural-resources-environmental-science/nres-phd-program/doctor-of-philosophy-handbook">NRES
PhD</a>.</p>
<p>Read the above manuals to get a sense of academic requirements for
relevant programs. For example, these programs may have expectations
about when a proposal needs to be completed by and/or minimum GPA
requirements during the program. In my opinion, your grades in grad
school are less important than the quality of your research, as long as
you always get at least a “B”. However, some scholarships or grants may
be merit-based, and grades may count ranking criteria.</p>
</div>
<div id="teaching" class="section level3">
<h3><u><strong>Teaching</strong></u></h3>
<p>If you’re considering a future career in academia, there are many
opportunities to gain teaching experience during your time in the lab.
These include serving as a teaching assistant (TA), acting as a primary
course instructor, giving guest lectures, and mentoring undergraduate
students. We can discuss your interests and available opportunities when
you arrive.</p>
<p>Ph.D. students in the EECB (see Academic Requirements above) are
required to serve as a TA for at least one semester. This may apply to
NRES as well. This teaching requirement is typically supported by
funding from UNR and the relevant academic department.</p>
</div>
<div id="work-schedule-and-vacations" class="section level3">
<h3><u><strong>Work schedule and vacations</strong></u></h3>
<p>Research and graduate school are academic pursuits – not typical
9-to-5 jobs – and very few students succeed by working only a standard
40-hour week. My philosophy is simple: do whatever it takes to get the
job done. If you find yourself frequently worried about how many hours
you’re putting in, graduate school might not be the right fit for
you.</p>
<p>That said, I also prioritize your physical and mental well-being, as
staying healthy is essential to sustained productivity, success, and
happiness. If you feel that additional support or resources would help
you make progress, please let me know – I am committed to helping you
succeed.</p>
<p>I do not monitor my students’ work hours closely; instead, I trust
you to manage your time responsibly. As long as you are making steady
progress toward your project goals, you may choose your own schedule.
However, I generally expect you to be available on campus, in the lab,
or office, during normal weekday working hours, unless we agree
otherwise.</p>
<p>Graduate students do not accrue vacation time formally, but my policy
provides 23 weekdays off per year, including state/federal holidays that
fall on weekdays – roughly one month of time off annually. I expect
students to schedule vacations and days off thoughtfully, avoiding
critical work periods whenever possible. Please inform me in advance
about your planned time off, and let’s both keep track of your vacation
days.</p>
<p>When you are sick, please take the necessary time to recover – this
is not counted as vacation time.</p>
</div>
<div id="professional-organizations" class="section level3">
<h3><u><strong>Professional Organizations</strong></u></h3>
<p>For many students, graduate school is the first step toward building
a professional career. As an emerging professional, I expect you to
become actively involved in relevant professional organizations. For
many in the lab, this will include societies such as The Wildlife
Society – including national, regional, or state chapters – or another
taxon-specific society (e.g., American Society of Mammalogists, Society
for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles, etc.). I strongly encourage
you to join both the parent societies and local chapters relevant to
your discipline; great for knowledge transfer and networking at national
and local scales, respectively.</p>
<p>Student membership fees are generally modest, and the benefits are
substantial: educational and career development opportunities, access to
extensive professional networks, and the demonstration of your
commitment to your field. Beyond joining, I expect you to participate
actively by attending meetings and contributing your time and energy to
society activities.</p>
</div>
<div id="presentations" class="section level3">
<h3><u><strong>Presentations</strong></u></h3>
<p>Oral presentation skills are essential for any career in our field,
and the more practice you get during graduate school, the stronger these
skills will become. As an early-career scientist, your professional
reputation will often be shaped first by your presentations at
conferences. While publications tend to be fewer and come later,
presentations are opportunities you can seize frequently and early.</p>
<p>I teach my students how to give great talks. I encourage you to
present your work multiple times throughout your graduate career. To
support this, I allocate funding to ensure that each student can present
at least once at a national or major regional conference before
graduation. Delivering effective and interesting talks will positively
impact your career.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-management" class="section level3">
<h3><u><strong>Data Management</strong></u></h3>
<p>Reproducible research is a cornerstone of good science and a major
focus in our field today. Recent USGS policies require data management
plans before starting projects, as well as online data publication after
project completion. I expect all students and staff to maintain
thorough, organized records and to follow best practices for
reproducible research – including clear data organization and version
control of code.</p>
<p>I expect all students and staff in the lab group to (i) store all of
their data on the university server, (ii) maintain organized analysis
workflows (and potentially data) in the laboratory GitHub repository,
and (iii) to be organized and well documented about data storage and
analysis version control throughout their program. At the end of your
time in the lab, you will be required to provide me with clean,
well-documented copies of your thesis or dissertation data and analysis
scripts – so I expect you to stay on top of this throughout the
program.</p>
<p>Additionally, all project data must be backed up both physically
(e.g., external hard drives) and in the cloud. I will cover any costs
and provide access to cloud storage solutions (e.g., university server,
Box, etc.), to ensure your work is securely preserved.</p>
</div>
<div id="publications" class="section level3">
<h3><u><strong>Publications</strong></u></h3>
<p>Our research goal is straightforward: to conduct the highest-quality
studies in the field – focused on applications for local and regional
agencies managing wildlife and habitats – and to publish these findings
in leading journals, such as <em>Ecological Applications</em>,
<em>Journal of Applied Ecology</em>, <em>Journal of Wildlife
Management</em>, or other taxon-specific journals of similar
caliber.</p>
<p>I expect all graduate students to publish their thesis research in
peer-reviewed journals. Conducting research without publishing it
diminishes its impact and value. Publishing your thesis chapters serves
several key purposes:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>It provides a valuable learning experience, guided by an experienced
coauthor (me).</li>
<li>It offers an objective, third-party validation of your work’s
quality and credibility.</li>
<li>It disseminates your research findings to a global scientific
audience.</li>
</ol>
<p>Peer-reviewed publications are also critical indicators of your
scientific skills and professionalism to prospective employers.</p>
<p>While the publication process can be lengthy and challenging, I
expect students to actively manage and prioritize publishing their work
– even after graduation. If substantial progress on publishing thesis or
dissertation chapters is not made within one year of graduation, I
reserve the right to take over the publication process as the
corresponding or lead author.</p>
</div>
<div id="working-in-the-coop-unit" class="section level3">
<h3><u><strong>Working in the Coop Unit</strong></u></h3>
<p>As a member of my lab, you are automatically part of the <a
href="https://www.unr.edu/nvcfwru">Nevada Cooperative Fish and Wildlife
Research Unit (NVCFWRU)</a>. The Cooperative Research Unit (CRU) program
is a nationwide initiative administered by the USGS, dedicated to
supporting graduate student training that advances science-based
management of fish, wildlife, and their habitats.</p>
<p>The primary partners of the NVCFWRU include the USGS, Nevada
Department of Wildlife, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Wildlife
Management Institute, and the University of Nevada, Reno. These
organizations provide significant support and funding for the operation
of the Unit.</p>
<p>Many student projects in my lab receive funding from these agencies,
and we maintain close collaboration with their scientists and managers.
Building strong professional relationships with biologists and
administrators from our partner agencies is critical for the success of
current and future projects. Accordingly, we prioritize effective
communication of research results and remain mindful of the agencies’
goals and constraints.</p>
<p>To facilitate this, we plan to present research findings annually
through posters or oral presentations at relevant state and regional
meetings, such as the Nevada Chapter of The Wildlife Society, Western
Section of TWS Meeting, Desert Tortoise Council, etc.</p>
<p>As a student in a Coop Unit, you will be expected to adhere to
various safety, data, and publication procedures that are required of
USGS scientists. Please review this <a
href="https://wilddecisions.github.io/files/cru_student_manual_2025.pdf">document</a>,
which summarizes expectations for Coop Unit students. For more
information about the Cooperative Research Unit program, please visit
the <a href="">NVCFWRU</a> and USGS CRU websites (this one is under
construction - July 2025).</p>
</div>
<div id="wildlife-decision-support-shop" class="section level3">
<h3><u><strong>Wildlife Decision-Support Shop</strong></u></h3>
<p>Our lab group is the <a
href="https://wilddecisions.github.io/">Wildlife Decision-Support
Shop</a>. The Shop is organized within the Nevada Cooperative Fish and
Wildlife Research Unit and benefits from having the support of the <a
href="https://www.unr.edu/nvcfwru/contact-us/falke-jeff">Unit
Leader</a>, Unit <a
href="https://www.unr.edu/nvcfwru/contact-us/grove-jennifer">administrative
assistant</a>, among other staff. These folks can offer useful
assistance with your research and academic pursuits at UNR. That said,
if one of these folks or another collaborator asks you to do something
related to your project or our shared work, treat the request as if it
came directly from me – with the same level of professionalism and
priority.</p>
<p>The Shop will be dynamic, with students, postdocs, and staff at
different stages of experience rotating through over time. One of the
greatest advantages of graduate school is the opportunity to learn from
and collaborate with your peers, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty
members. I expect you to make the most of this collaborative environment
– but never take advantage of it.</p>
<p>And finally, it should go without saying: treat everyone with
respect, especially our support staff, technicians, and fellow students.
A healthy and respectful lab culture is essential to our collective
success. Our field is a “small world” and we should do our best to treat
everyone in it well.</p>

<h3><u><strong>Seminars</strong></u></h3>
<p>Graduate school is a time to immerse yourself in science and build a
broad understanding of the natural world. One of the great benefits of
this experience is the opportunity to learn about topics beyond your
specific research focus – and to observe, on a weekly basis, how
effective presentations are delivered.</p>
<p>Unless you are in the field or in class, I expect my students to
attend weekly seminars hosted by the Ecology, Evolution, and
Conservation Biology (EECB) Graduate Program Colloquium, the NRES
Seminar Series, and MS/PhD defenses within our department. These
seminars will not only expose you to new ideas, but they often spark
unexpected insights relevant to your own work. I can’t count how many
times a seemingly unrelated talk has inspired a new angle on a
project.</p>
<p>Your presence also supports your fellow students and colleagues.
There are few things more disheartening than preparing and delivering a
seminar to an empty room. Poor attendance reflects badly on our academic
department and our lab as a whole.</p>
<p>Though not required, I encourage you to also attend topical or
interdisciplinary seminars whenever they are related to your interests.
You never know what you might learn or who you might meet.</p>

<div id="safety" class="section level3">
<h3><u><strong>Safety</strong></u></h3>
<p>As a student in the Nevada Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research
Unit (NVCFWRU) and an employee under my supervision, you – and any
technicians working under you – are required to complete safety training
provided by UNR and USGS. Depending on your specific project, required
trainings may include defensive driving, laboratory safety, motorboat
operation, wildlife handling techniques, and others.</p>
<p>When you arrive, we will complete a Personal Hazard Analysis (PHA) to
determine which trainings are necessary for your role. It’s best to
complete these requirements early, as some of the modules can take
significant time.</p>
<p>When conducting fieldwork, you are responsible for the safety of
yourself and your team. This includes making judgment calls in the field
about whether conditions are safe for sampling. The USGS maintains a
strong culture of safety, and the guiding principle is clear: human
safety always takes precedence over data collection.</p>

<div id="other-expectations" class="section level3">
<h3><u><strong>Other Expectations</strong></u></h3>
<p>An important part of your graduate training – and your commitment to
this lab – is to participate fully as a member of both the Wildlife
Decision-Support Shop and the broader community of biologists and
ecologists in NRES, EECB, and the College of Agriculture, Biotechnology,
and Natural Resources (CABNR). UNR offers many opportunities for
intellectual growth, networking, and contribution. I expect students to
genuinely invest in the program by taking part in seminars, social
events, lab discussions, and presentation practice sessions.</p>
<p>I also encourage you to consider mentoring undergraduate students as
part of your research. Mentorship is a valuable professional development
opportunity for you, and it provides undergraduates with meaningful
exposure to the scientific process. UNR offers several programs to
facilitate undergraduate research involvement (e.g., the Undergraduate
Research Opportunity Program [UROP], Honors Program projects, or
department-sponsored initiatives).</p>
<p>Being actively engaged in our academic community enhances your own
personal and intellectual growth, while also helping to foster a
collaborative and supportive environment for everyone involved.</p>
<p>I hope none of the expectations outlined in this document seem
daunting – they are not meant to be! Graduate school should be one of
the most fulfilling and rewarding experiences of your life. If you
approach it with a clear understanding of what’s expected, an openness
to learning and growth, and a commitment to hard work, I’m confident you
will thrive here and beyond.</p>
<p>I have read and understand these expectations.</p>
